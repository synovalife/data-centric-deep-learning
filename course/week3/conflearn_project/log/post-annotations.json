It runs about $85 so its not inexpensive. I really had high hopes for this eye cream given my great experience with a lot of other products by this brand, but this was a let down. The positives: its light and a great formula for daytime use, it did not irritate my eyes in any way, a lot of it goes a long way and while expensive it did last a very long time. The negatives: it's expensive, I didn't see a real difference versus other cheaper eye creams I have used, the packaging is large and bulky. If the bottle were much less expensive I would consider repurchasing but at this price I think there are better options. On to trying the next!!!  For more reviews check out pimples and wrinkles.

I warm it up in my fingers and dab a little on my eyelid and smooth it over for a nice clean base. It makes eyeshadow stand out even more; they look more pigmented, rich, and they are easy to blend and last all day. It goes on creamy but it feels matte after you apply it, which is a nice change from other primers that feel too wet at times. A little definitely goes a long way with this primer, and it covers up any coloring or veins I have on my eyelids. I find that it also helps with under eye circles, so some mornings I just dab a little of that under my eyes instead of concealer. Just don't use too much! I've not had any bad reactions with wearing it, and I tend to have sensitive eyes with wearing contacts (and also with the spring allergies).\n\nHowever...\nThe Bad: I will say that while being matte is awesome, sometimes my eyelids feel incredibly dry if I use it too frequently. It dries incredibly fast so you have to apply it quickly. I just take my middle finger and do a circular motion in the pot to help warm it on my fingertip and do one eye at a time. I also think it'd be helpful if it came in two more shades. I have light skin and use the Taffy, but I can still see the color of the primer on my lid. This isn't a huge issue since eyeshadow layers on top, but I have to careful not to blend it out too far. I think if they had one shade lighter and darker it'd make it a much more versatile range of primers.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with this primer. I'm a fan of Stila makeup and it works very wells for me.\n\nEdit-\nI've been using this primer for much longer now and have to change my opinion on some things and my rating from 4 stars to 2. I had said before that my eyelids felt really dry afterwards. Well, this product is definitely not for continuous use. I can only use it maybe once a week! Otherwise my eyelids literally feel rough, itchy, and kind of crackly. It won't bother me after wearing it all day, but if I use it 2-3 days in a row, forget it. The price is too high for something I can only use 1-2 times a week. Plus who wants their eyelids to hurt?! I still think that the payoff is pretty great and that my shadows look great and don't crease. Just wish it wasn't so drying."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-08-02T05:05:14.489115Z","updated_at":"2024-08-02T05:25:38.622726Z","inner_id":306,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":344,"annotations":[{"id":12,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"data-60394","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"prediction"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-08-02T05:27:22.805666Z","updated_at":"2024-08-02T05:27:22.805686Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":17.309,"prediction":{"id":344,"model_version":"undefined","created_ago":"22 minutes","result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"data-60394","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices"}],"score":null,"cluster":null,"neighbors":null,"mislabeling":0.0,"created_at":"2024-08-02T05:05:14.973024Z","updated_at":"2024-08-02T05:05:14.973032Z","model":null,"model_run":null,"task":344,"project":1},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"8b680f77-b999-4ab2-ad76-b856fe543083","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":344,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":344,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"a67982a0-pre-annotations.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[344],"data":{"text":"I am usually a super huge fan of Jack Black products.
